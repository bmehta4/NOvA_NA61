This is the interface for classes that reweight interactions. The constructor for these classes should look like my\-Interaction\-Reweighting(int iuniv,\-Parameter\-Table\& cv\-\_\-pars, Parameter\-Table\& univ\-\_\-pars);.

\subsection{Detailed Description}
This is the interface for classes that reweight interactions. The constructor for these classes should look like my\-Interaction\-Reweighting(int iuniv,\-Parameter\-Table\& cv\-\_\-pars, Parameter\-Table\& univ\-\_\-pars);. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\-:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
