The interface for classes that reweight a chain of interactions, as needed for M\-I\-P\-P.  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$I\-Interaction\-Chain\-Reweighting.\-h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
The interface for classes that reweight a chain of interactions, as needed for M\-I\-P\-P. 

There is a 1 to 1 mapping between instances of I\-Interaction\-Chain\-Reweighting classes and universes (i.\-e., one object per universe. The constructor for these classes should look like my\-Chain\-Reweighting( Parameter\-Table\& cv\-\_\-pars, Parameter\-Table\& univ\-\_\-pars); 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\-:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
include/\hyperlink{_i_interaction_chain_reweighting_8h}{I\-Interaction\-Chain\-Reweighting.\-h}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
